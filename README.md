# Abstract

Being a subject that is under constant development, scientists are looking to elaborate systems that can automate all the processes that were once executed by people. The artificial intelligence field is set to build an intelligent machine that can understand how an individual thinks. Computer vision, a subfield of artificial intelligence is developing some algorithms that will be able to simulate the functionalities of human visual system. This paper presents an automatic process of grading multiple choice tests by performing a set of operations on those tests on the computer.

The first step is to take the grids from each paper and to detect the position of the answer that the student gave at the test. The computer must be able to perform this step without any errors.

The next step for the automated system is to go through supervised learning. The technique is similar to the way a teacher oversees the activities of his students. In this way, the system learns the right answers to a specific problem and will predict them. At the same time the results are analysed. This step should determin the number of the grid written on the test.

Lastly, the results will be returned to the user in a way that will be easily understood and analysed.
